# Just a quick todo app

I built this to...

1. Improve my skills in working with databases. I built this same site in Postgres, MySql, & Sqlite. (Postgres is my fav)
2. Solidify theming and having people save a theme choice to their database profile
3. A lil helper to track my own progress of regular tasks. :)
